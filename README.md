---

The car in the following video uses Model Predictive Control (MPC) to drive around a closed track.
This involves using a real physics model, combined with minimizing a cost function. For added challenge,
all steering commands are delayed by 1/10 of a second so that the model needs to predict the future
situation and determine what command would be helpful in that situation.

## Relationship to Other Components

The controller is responsible for low-level control of the vehicle, such as steering, accelerating,
and braking. The controller receives its own location from the localization component and receives speed and
a list of waypoints from the planning component. The controller must determine an appropriate series
of actions to balance the competing requirements to stay close to the planned waypoints, maintain
the desired speed, and ensure a smooth ride.

## Plotting a Course

The controller converts waypoints into a coordinate system relative to the car's location and orientation,
then reinterprets those waypoints as a best-fit polynomial. The continuity and smoothness of a polynomial
makes it much more suitable for estimating positional and directional error. The positional error, also known
as Cross-Track Error (CTE), is the distance from the car's location to the nearest point on the polynomial
plan. The directional error is the difference in direction between the car and the nearest point on the 
polynomial plan.

## Physics-Based Prediction

This MPC uses a simple physics model based on X state variables (x, y, speed, direction) and 
two actuation variables (steering and acceleration).

Physics calculations are performed for ten
discrete time intervals spread equally over one second. A longer horizon of around three seconds would likely
be needed for high speed, but one second is sufficient to drive safely at 30 MPH.

## Compensating for Delay

All commands (steering and acceleration) are delayed by 1/10 of a second for an added challenge.
This MPC compensates by predicting how the previous commands will affect the vehicle's state over
the next 1/10 of a second and using that predicted future state as the starting state for the rest of
the MPC calculation process.

## Cost Optimization

The MPC uses a cost function to balance the competing requirements to stay close to the 
planned waypoints, maintain the desired speed, and ensure a smooth ride.

* Distance from center
  * Prefer to be in the center of the road.
  * Cost contribution is distance to the 4th power. This creates a small cost
    for moving towards the edge of the road and a large cost for going off-road.
* Orientation
  * Prefer orientation in the direction of the road.
* Speed
  * Prefer to drive 30 MPH.
* Minimize controls
  * Prefer to turn the steering wheel as little as possible.
  * Prefer to brake and accelerate as little as possible.
* Minimize change in controls (jerkiness)
  * Prefer steering angle to be close to the steering angle of the previous timestep.
  * Prefer acceleration to be close to the acceleration of the previous timestep.
* Constraints
  * Steering angle limited to -25 degrees to 25 degrees.
  * Acceleration limited to -1 to +1.
  
Ipopt and CppAD selects a series of steering and throttle values to minimize the cost
function. The MPC selects only the first pair of steering and throttle values to
control the vehicle.

  * Run either `install-mac.sh` or `install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets 
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Fortran Compiler
  * Mac: `brew install gcc` (might not be required)
  * Linux: `sudo apt-get install gfortran`. Additionall you have also have to install gcc and g++, `sudo apt-get install gcc g++`. Look in [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Quizzes/blob/master/Dockerfile) for more info.
* [Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt)
  * Mac: `brew install ipopt`
  * Linux
    * You will need a version of Ipopt 3.12.1 or higher. The version available through `apt-get` is 3.11.x. If you can get that version to work great but if not there's a script `install_ipopt.sh` that will install Ipopt. You just need to download the source from the Ipopt [releases page](https://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Ipopt/) or the [Github releases](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt/releases) page.
    * Then call `install_ipopt.sh` with the source directory as the first argument, ex: `sudo bash install_ipopt.sh Ipopt-3.12.1`. 
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [CppAD](https://www.coin-or.org/CppAD/)
  * Mac: `brew install cppad`
  * Linux `sudo apt-get install cppad` or equivalent.
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). This is already part of the repo so you shouldn't have to worry about it.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [releases tab](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).
* Not a dependency but read the [DATA.md](./DATA.md) for a description of the data sent back from the simulator.


## Basic Build Instructions


1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
